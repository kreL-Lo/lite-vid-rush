EDITOR : CURSOR 
START SCAFOLODING CURSOR PROMPT 

You are a senior full-stack engineer.  
Create a new **Next.js 14 App Router project** with **TypeScript** and **TailwindCSS** preconfigured.  
Scaffold the following structure and baseline files:

1. **Project Setup**
   - Install: next, react, react-dom, typescript, tailwindcss, postcss, autoprefixer, @remotion/player, @remotion/renderer, zustand, immer, zod, dnd-kit, react-hook-form, @hookform/resolvers, @radix-ui/react-slider, lucide-react, next-connect, formidable, ffmpeg-static, ffprobe-static.
   - Add devDeps: eslint, prettier, husky, lint-staged, vitest, @testing-library/react, jsdom.
   - Configure Tailwind with shadcn/ui (components.json).

2. **Folder Structure**
   - `/app` (Next.js app router)
     - `/editor/page.tsx` â†’ main editor page
     - `/api/render/route.ts` â†’ POST handler using Remotion renderer
     - `/api/media/route.ts` â†’ simple upload handler (formidable)
   - `/components` â†’ reusable UI parts (Timeline, ClipItem, Inspector, Scrubber, PlayControls)
   - `/lib`
     - `store.ts` â†’ zustand store with timeline state (media track, text track, selection, playhead)
     - `types.ts` â†’ strongly typed data model (Clip, TextOverlay, EditorState)
     - `timelineOps.ts` â†’ pure functions for add/trim/reorder
   - `/remotion`
     - `RootComposition.tsx` â†’ Remotion Composition rendering clips/text based on EditorState

3. **Editor State Model**
   - `EditorState`: `{ media: Clip[], texts: TextOverlay[], selectedId: string | null, playhead: number (frames) }`
   - `Clip`: `{ id, src, startFrame, endFrame, order }`
   - `TextOverlay`: `{ id, text, startFrame, endFrame, position, style }`

4. **Initial Implementation**
   - Minimal UI with:
     - Track list (renders each clip/text)
     - Simple inspector (editable text or start/end frame)
     - Play/pause button + slider for scrubbing
   - Wire state with zustand, use immer for immutable updates.
   - Add a placeholder Remotion preview using @remotion/player reading from `EditorState`.

5. **API Render Endpoint**
   - Validate request body with zod (EditorState schema).
   - Call `@remotion/renderer.renderMedia` with RootComposition.
   - Return a small MP4 (â‰¤5s, 1280x720, deterministic).

6. **Testing Setup**
   - Vitest + Testing Library for `timelineOps` (trim/reorder unit tests).

Add clear comments and TODO markers for unimplemented features (drag reorder, waveform preview).  
Keep everything minimal but production-quality, with proper error handling and TypeScript types.

PROMPT 4:

FROM HERE PROMPTS WERE MOSTLY ABOUT FIXING TYPING, STYLES AND LIBRARY INTEGRATION BUGS 


Major prompts used:

-> Building local upload server side 

-> Building remotion on server side 

Check cursor output pipeline
